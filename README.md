### OnlyWorlds Development Repository

OnlyWorlds is a world-building framework that enables the creation, sharing and simulation of worlds across a wide range of tools and applications.

It is currently in closed alpha release. The core data definitions are available in their first public draft, and several prototype tools are avalaible that enable you to build worlds to share between them.

This repository is under construction with the future goal of supporting developers to build for and integrate the framework in any kind of tooling or application.

The _schema_ folder has the source-of-truth data definitions in YAML.

The _languages_ folder contains subfolders with that same schema in various languages, auto-updated when the _schema_ folder gets changed. Many more languages to follow.

### API (in development)
 
Users can create worlds on the OnlyWorlds website. These worlds are created with a unique API key.

Applications can send and receive worlds using these API keys and private user PIN codes.
