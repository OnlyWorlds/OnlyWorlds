## OnlyWorlds 
 
OnlyWorlds is an **open-source worldbuilding** framework designed to create, store, and exchange structured world data across different applications. 

Whether you're writing a novel, developing a game, or simulating a historical economy, OnlyWorlds provides a universal format that offers **portability, interoperability, collaboration, and long-term storage** for world builders.

### Why OnlyWorlds? 

Most worldbuilding tools lock users into **proprietary formats** or **isolated ecosystems**. 

OnlyWorlds provides:
- A **standardized schema** for representing worlds, characters, locations, and 16 other category types.
- **Interoperability** between writing tools, map editors, TTRPG apps, game engines, and more.
- **Flexibility** for different genres, styles, and levels of complexity.
- **Open-source governance**, and a creators-first philosophy to keep full creative and practical control over your work. 
- Facilitation of **infrastructure** and a **developer ecosystem** with no commercial restrictions or limits.

### How It Works
- At its core, OnlyWorlds provides a **structured data model** for properties of worlds and their elements.
- These are defined in a central YAML-based schema, with auto conversion into many other languages.
- They are **subject to community input**: a collaborative effort towards intuitive building blocks for the widest range of worlds, applications, and socio-political-economic dynamics.

### Example Use Cases
- **Writers**: Create intricate and well-organized worlds that can be adapted to various medias.
- **TTRPG Game Masters**: Organize maps, content, world lore, and track or generate party progress.
- **Game Developers**: Employ world data in game-ready formats (e.g. in Unity editor plugins, Unreal, Godot).
- **Educators & Academics**: Use structured data for world simulation and historical recreation.
