## üîß Schema Philosophy

OnlyWorlds is designed as a **flexible, open foundation**. The schema is:

* Structured with **JSON Schema** (in YAML format)
* Extensible by design
* Community-evolving: we treat this as a shared standard, not a fixed spec

We strongly prefer evolutionary, backwards-compatible changes when possible.
